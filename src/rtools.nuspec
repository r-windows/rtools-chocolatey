    <description>Rtools is the toolchain bundle that is used on Windows to build R base and R packages that contain compiled code. You only need Rtools if you want to compile R packages from source that contain C/C++/Fortran. By default, R for Windows installs the precompiled binary packages from CRAN, for which you do not need rtools. This Chocolatey package works with the installation defaults, which consist of the standard toolchains based on gcc (32/64 bit mingw-w64) and build utilities (make, bash, tar, sed, etc).</description>
    <summary>A collection of tools for building R packages under Windows</summary>
    <releaseNotes>Rtools is a toolchain bundle used for building R packages from source (those that need compilation of C/C++ or Fortran code) and for build R itself.

Rtools44 consists of Msys2 build tools, GCC 13/MinGW-w64 compiler toolchain, libraries built using the toolchain, and QPDF. Rtools44 supports 64-bit Windows and UCRT as the C runtime.
