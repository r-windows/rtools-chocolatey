# Release Notes for Versions 4.3.0 and up

This Chocolatey package does not set the PATH environment variable anymore; the end user must follow upstream installation instructions to select a version of RTools.

# Building This Package

To build this package, type

```bash
cd src
choco pack
choco push --source https://push.chocolatey.org/
```
